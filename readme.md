Overview
The Snake game is a simple and classic game where the player controls a snake that moves around a grid, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the boundaries of the game area. The program consists of three main parts: the HTML structure, the CSS styling, and the JavaScript logic.

HTML Structure
The HTML defines the basic structure of the game. It includes a canvas element where the game will be rendered:

CSS Styling
The CSS styles the page and centers the canvas in the viewport:

The body is styled to center the canvas both vertically and horizontally using flexbox.
The canvas has a black background and a white border to distinguish it from the rest of the page.
JavaScript Logic
The JavaScript code handles the game logic, including the initialization, game loop, drawing, movement, and input handling.

Initialization:

Sets up the game state with an initial snake, food, and score.
Defines the grid size and canvas size.
Game Loop:

Uses setTimeout to continuously update the game state at regular intervals.
Clears the canvas, moves the snake, checks for collisions, and draws the snake and food.
Drawing:

clearCanvas(): Clears the canvas.
drawFood(): Draws the food on the canvas.
drawSnake(): Draws the snake on the canvas.
Movement:

moveSnake(): Updates the position of the snake based on the current direction.
Checks if the snake has eaten the food, grows the snake, and places new food.
Collision Detection:

isGameOver(): Checks if the snake has collided with the walls or itself.
Input Handling:

Listens for arrow key presses to change the direction of the snake.
Example Game Loop
Here's a simplified explanation of what happens during each iteration of the game loop:

Clear the Canvas: The current frame is cleared to prepare for the new frame.
Draw the Food: The food is drawn on the canvas.
Move the Snake: The snake's position is updated based on its current direction.
Check for Collisions: If the snake collides with the wall or itself, the game ends.
Draw the Snake: The snake is drawn on the canvas.
Repeat: The game loop continues, creating a smooth animation.
Game Controls
The player uses the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake:
Up arrow (ArrowUp)
Down arrow (ArrowDown)
Left arrow (ArrowLeft)
Right arrow (ArrowRight)
By structuring the game in this way, the code ensures that the game is easy to understand, maintain, and extend. You can add features such as levels, obstacles, or a scoring system to make the game more interesting.
